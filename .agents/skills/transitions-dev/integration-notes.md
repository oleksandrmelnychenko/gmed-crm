# Integration notes

Consult the relevant item when adapting a snippet or diagnosing replay, closing, layout, or browser issues. Keep framework lifecycle cleanup and existing component accessibility behavior.

- **Stripping the close-state class cleanup** on dropdown/modal — without the `setTimeout` that removes `.is-closing`, the next open jumps from the closing scale instead of the resting pre-open scale.
- **Forgetting the reflow** in the text swap, number pop-in, success check replay, and error state shake — `void el.offsetWidth` (or `offsetHeight`) between class/attribute removal and re-addition is what guarantees the animation replays.
- **Animating a single container** instead of the inner pieces — for the badge, animate the dot, not the trigger; for page slide, animate the page sections, not the container.
- **Replacing `transition: …` with `transition: all`** — every snippet enumerates exact properties on purpose so unrelated style changes don't ride in for free.
- **Hardcoding the success check's `stroke-dasharray`** — the snippet ships `20` as a placeholder. Replace it with `path.getTotalLength()` rounded up by 1 for *your* path, otherwise the stroke pre-reveals or over-draws.
- **Setting `transition-timing-function` in CSS** for the avatar group hover — it has to be set inline in JS *before* the `--shift` / `--scale-active` writes so the bouncy ease-out only applies on `mouseleave`.
- **Mixing `.is-error` and `.is-shaking` into one class** for the error state shake — keeping them orthogonal is what allows the shake to replay (remove → reflow → re-add) without flickering the whole error treatment.
- **Leaving the input clear glow on `mix-blend-mode: multiply` in dark mode** — flip to `screen`, bump `--glow-opacity` to ~0.85, and paint white gradients in JS.
- **Forgetting to write the tabs pill's first position without a transition** — on first paint and resize, set `transform` + `width` with `transition: none` (then reflow + restore) or the pill animates in from `translateX(0)` / `width: 0`.
- **Tracking the pointer on the tilting element itself** for card hover tilt — bind `pointermove` to the flat outer `.t-tilt` wrapper, not `.t-tilt-card`, or the rotating edges slip under the cursor and the hover flickers.
- **Padding on the accordion grid track** — put padding on `.t-acc-panel-inner`, never on `.t-acc-panel`; padding on the `0fr` track leaves a residual height strip so the panel never fully closes.
- **Morphing the accordion chevron's `d` path** — CSS `d:` path interpolation is Chromium-only, so it never animates on mobile Safari / Firefox. Flip the chevron vertically (`transform: scaleY(-1)`) instead — it passes through a flat line at the midpoint just like the path morph and works everywhere. Keep the path symmetric about its viewBox centre and add `vector-effect: non-scaling-stroke` so the stroke stays constant through the flip. This is what the snippet ships.
